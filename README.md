# Intel Image Classification using PyTorch

The project presents a walkthrough of a jupyter notebook to classify images of nature scenes of 6 different categories with **Transfer learning in PyTorch** using the Intel Image Classification dataset. The project was built as the final assignment course project for the [Deep Learning with PyTorch - Zero to GANS](https://jovian.ai/learn/deep-learning-with-pytorch-zero-to-gans) course offered by **FreeCodeCamp** and **Jovian**.

### About the data:
The dataset was initially created by Intel for an image classification contest. It is an expansive image dataset consisting of approximately **25,000 images**. The images are divided into the following categories: **buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street**. Our task is to train a model using PyTorch to classify the image as one of the 6 categories.

### Project organisation:
The project work is organised as follows:

1. Collecting Dataset
2. Defining Problem Statement
3. Data Exploration and Cleaning
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation and Prediction
6. Improvement
7. Conclusion and Summary

### Results:
The final model achieved an accuracy of about 93% which can still be improved.
